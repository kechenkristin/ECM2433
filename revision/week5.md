## cpp: the C preprocessor
### Compiler directives
- giving your programs access to useful library functions and values  
- controlling what code gets compiled
- defining macros to make your code more readable
- defining macros for values that might change some time in the future

### Macro names
- Informal rule: macro name is all capitals  
C has many informal rules; this one makes your code easier to follow
- System macros start with two underscores  
so that they do not interfere with your own macros, and so that you can recognise them

### C program structure
- separate code modules

- compiling and linking

- storage classes
	- auto(default)
	- register
	- static https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/112027143
